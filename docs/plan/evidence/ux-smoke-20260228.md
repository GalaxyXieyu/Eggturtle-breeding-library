# UX Smoke Execution (2026-02-28)

This doc records UX smoke steps and where to find evidence artifacts.

## Evidence Artifacts
- Screenshots directory (local, not committed): `out/ui-smoke/20260228-*/`
- This run: `out/ui-smoke/20260228-162328/`

## Minimal Smoke Path (start)
1. Admin login (dev code) -> open `/dashboard/tenants`.
2. Open a tenant detail -> verify members section renders.
3. Open `/dashboard/memberships` -> remove a member (if safe) -> verify row removed + audit message.
4. On tenant detail page -> verify "Subscription & quota" section can load and save.

## Run Summary (2026-02-28 16:23~16:55, Asia/Shanghai)
### Passed
- Web auth/session: password success/failure, code login, i18n toggle, guard redirect.
- Web core flow: tenant-select, switch tenant, series list, breeders list, breeder detail.
- Web public share: success page + invalid-link error page.
- Admin flow: allowlist deny, code login, password login, tenants list, tenant subscription panel, memberships page (confirm-remove state), audit-log filters page.

### Non-product interruptions (already recovered)
- `http://localhost:30011` had a temporary downtime, causing `Failed to fetch` in web login code request.
- Chrome DevTools MCP session disconnected twice; reconnected by restarting Chrome remote debugging on `127.0.0.1:9222`.

### Screenshots captured
- `01-auth/`: 8 files
- `02-web-core/`: 6 files
- `03-featured-share/`: 2 files
- `05-admin/`: 5 files

### Notes
- Membership remove flow was validated up to confirmation UI (`确认移除`), then canceled to avoid deleting real members during smoke.
- No deterministic product bug reproduced in this run; current failures were environment/tooling interruptions.
