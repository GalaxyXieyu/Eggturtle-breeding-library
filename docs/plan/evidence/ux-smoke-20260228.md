# UX Smoke Execution (2026-02-28)

This doc records UX smoke steps and where to find evidence artifacts.

## Evidence Artifacts
- Screenshots directory (local, not committed): `out/ui-smoke/20260228-*/`

## Minimal Smoke Path (start)
1. Admin login (dev code) -> open `/dashboard/tenants`.
2. Open a tenant detail -> verify members section renders.
3. Open `/dashboard/memberships` -> remove a member (if safe) -> verify row removed + audit message.
4. On tenant detail page -> verify "Subscription & quota" section can load and save.

## Notes
- For each step, capture 1-2 screenshots and name them with the step number.
- If a step fails, record exact error message and (if present) `errorCode`.
